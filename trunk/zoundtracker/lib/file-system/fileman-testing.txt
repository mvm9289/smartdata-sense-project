File Manager Testing
--------------------

1. File "/tests/file-system/fileman-test1.c":
  Tests 'read' and 'write' functions.
  
  a) When 'writeSampleNumber' reachs MAX_SAMPLE_NUMBER at the first time
     all the next read calls read zero bytes (there's no an explicit 
     'updateReadFile' call).
  
  b) When 'storedFiles' reachs MAX_STORED_FILES the current
     'readFile' is updated and the next 'read' calls read the new 
     'readFile'.
  
  (!) If 'storedFiles' reachs MAX_STORED_FILES and the Mobile Node is 
      sending te current 'readFile' then the current 'readFile' is 
      deleted and it can't be resent if there's an error on Basestation 
      acknowledgement.

2. File "/tests/file-system/fileman-test2.c':
  Tests 'readSeek' function.
  
  a) When the first 'readFile' es completely readed the read file offset
     pointer is updated to SEEK_POSITION:
     
     0 <= SEEK_POSITION < MAX_SAMPLE_NUMBER
       The next 'read' call reads the current 'readFile' from the 
       SEEK_POSITION position.
     
     SEEK_POSITION >= MAX_SAMPLE NUMBER
       The next 'read' call reads the current 'readFile' from the 
       last position (the number of bytes readed is zero).
     
     SEEK_POSITION < 0
       The read file offset pointer is not updated.
